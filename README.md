# Titanic EDA Project

## Description
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and other factors influencing survival. The analysis includes visualizations, data cleaning, and feature exploration to better understand the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), which contains information about passengers, including:
- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

Additionally, a `gender_submission.csv` file is included for reference.

## Files
- `titanic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all EDA steps, visualizations, and analyses.
- `Titanic_EDA.html` – HTML version of the notebook.
- `Titanic_EDA.pdf` – PDF version of the notebook.
- `train.csv` – Training dataset.
- `gender_submission.csv` – Sample submission for the Kaggle competition.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading and Inspection** – Importing libraries and examining the dataset structure.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Summary statistics, distributions, and correlation analysis.
4. **Visualization** – Using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize relationships, trends, and patterns.
5. **Insights** – Key observations about survival rates, age, gender, class, and other features.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
